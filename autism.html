      <h1>What is Autism?</h1>
      <h3>There is no type of autism, but many.</h3>
      <p>
        Autism, or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), refers to a broad range of
        conditions characterized by challenges with social skills, repetitive
        behaviors, speech and nonverbal communication. According to the Centers
        for Disease Control, autism affects an estimated 1 in 44 children in the
        United States today. We know that there is not one autism but many
        subtypes, most influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental
        factors. Because autism is a spectrum disorder, each person with autism
        has a distinct set of strengths and challenges. The ways in which people
        with autism learn, think and problem-solve can range from highly skilled
        to severely challenged. Some people with ASD may require significant
        support in their daily lives, while others may need less support and, in
        some cases, live entirely independently. Several factors may influence
        the development of autism, and it is often accompanied by sensory
        sensitivities and medical issues such as gastrointestinal (GI)
        disorders, seizures or sleep disorders, as well as mental health
        challenges such as anxiety, depression and attention issues. Signs of
        autism usually appear by age 2 or 3. Some associated development delays
        can appear even earlier, and often, it can be diagnosed as early as 18
        months. Research shows that early intervention leads to positive
        outcomes later in life for people with autism.<br />

        * In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association merged four distinct
        autism diagnoses into one umbrella diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder
        (ASD). They included autistic disorder, childhood disintegrative
        disorder, pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified
        (PDD-NOS) and Asperger syndrome.
